title: A return to the bee on a thistle
---

I take a fair number of pictures with my cell phone camera, and I'm usually quite happy
with the way they turn out. I see them on my computer screen, formatted for Google+,
and then I'm on my way.

What I never realized was that these photos are HUGE!
[Bee on a thistle](http://www.heycascadia.com/2014/08/07/bee-on-a-thistle/), for example,
is a whopping 2432 Ã— 4320 pixels. I loaded it up full-size in my browser and was
blown away by the detail.

My Moto X took this photo; I've cropped in to a small part of it, about 1000x1000 pixels.
The blog shrinks it down to about 600px, but it gives you an idea of the detail that
a cell phone camera can catch.
