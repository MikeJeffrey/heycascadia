title: You have to solder Arduino shields!
---

It's so obvious to everyone else, that I couldn't find any reference to it on the internet:
**you have to solder an Arduino shield**.

I thought it was plug and play, since the little header pins seemed very snug when I
put the shield over the Arduino Uno. But the shield wasn't working, and it turns out
the each pin needs to be soldered.

Luckily, soldering is very easy, and I was able to do it in less than 10 minutes, never
having soldered before. It's worth checking out some YouTube vids before you start, though.
